Project-Name-Generator: (Python 3.6.0)

This generator will randomly pick from a random adjective and noun and prints out absurd combinations of them, currently there are 3 diffrent adjective and noun pools.

This project was made in python after I had trouble getting [Kohsuke's](https://github.com/kohsuke/wordnet-random-name) java version working.
